# UnPunchMan

An example game for a talk about making games.

## Story

All the citizens of Helping Town were very helpful and happy. But then came
Opposite Day! Now help hurts and hurt helps. Their only hope is Big Terri,
the retired boxer. Every time he punches someone, they feel better!

He promised he'd never punch anyone again.

But promises don't work on Opposite Day...

## Mechanics

* Punch somebody and they feel better.
* When they feel better, they'll try to help you.
* Their med-kits will make you weaker.
* Their helping you across the road will make a car hit you.
* Pits will make you fly up instead of fall down.
* Spikes and electricity will help you.
